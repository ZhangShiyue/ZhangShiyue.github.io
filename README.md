# Hello World!

<img src="./img/shiyueatnaacl.jpeg" alt="shiyueatnaacl" width="400"/>

I am Shiyue Zhang (张诗悦). I have been a Research Scientist/Engineer at [Bloomberg AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/artificial-intelligence-ai/) since August 2023. 

Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at UNC Chapel Hill, advised by Prof. [Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/) and partially sponsored by [Bloomberg Data Science PhD Fellowship](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/announcing-bloomberg-data-science-ph-d-fellowship-winners-2021-2022/).

## Research
I am interested in any fun topics related to language modeling. 

See the complete list of my publications at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=co9KUGQAAAAJ&hl=en) and my <a href="files/Shiyue_Zhang_CV.pdf">CV</a>.
