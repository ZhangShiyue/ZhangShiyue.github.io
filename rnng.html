        Figure above shows our initial idea of adding a memory component to RNNG, and we also tried some variations.
        The main idea behind this design is to expect memory to cover the 'outliers' of neural model, so memory
        memorizes 'wrong instances' of rnng. This idea based on that the 'outliers' also have a rule, or is common in
        some way, so memory can learn. But experiments showed the RNNG model did quite well on PTB data, and left little
        room for improvement. Most of memorized wrong instances are like noise and hard to learn a rule from, and
        bring an inevitably adverse effect to neural model. And I also tried to carefully select instances to memorize,
        but it's hard and trival. We couldn't find a good way to solve this problm, so this work was halted by the end of
        2016.

        Reality bites, but, at least, I gained a lot of experience from this process. I wrote a
